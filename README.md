This is just a frontend skeleton for kickstarting projects that will be using Gulp/Babel (ES 2015) + Browserify/SASS/Jasmine.

Also included is lodash/jQuery/Bootstrap/Font Awesome via Bower.

There are two ways to use this skeleton:
Method 1 (Retains /build)
npm install
bower install

Method 2 (Use Gulp to generate a new build)
npm start

If you'd like to use another grid system or CSS framework feel free to just run:
bower uninstall bootstrap-sass
bower uninstall font-awesome
bower uninstall jquery

Prerequisites:
Node (NPM)
Git
